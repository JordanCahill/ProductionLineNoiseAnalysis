## Introduction 
This application builds off the automated visual inspection application to investigate the effects of noise on an image processing application, as well as the performance of an image processing application after applying different noise removal filter techniques.

Part one deals with the evaluation of a visual inspection system with with Gaussian noise. Part two investigates the removal of this noise using different types of spacial domain filtering and frequency domain filtering.

### Part One:
Part one chooses three fault categories from the previous application. The "imnoise" function is used to add Gaussian noise for each fault of increasing levels of noise variance. Each fault is then checked using the same methods as previous and the results are graphed. The overall performance can be seen below.
